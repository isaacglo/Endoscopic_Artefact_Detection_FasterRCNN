# Endoscopic_Artefact_Detection_FasterRCNN
This repository contains a small project for endoscopic artefact detection done with the MMDetection toolbox from OpenMMLab. The algorithm algorithm used for the object detection is Faster RCNN. The entire project can be donee using Google Colabs GPUs. At the end of the project is shown few image with the classification and detection of multiple objects in endoscopy images.

The dataset is located at https://www.dropbox.com/s/mrqvb9jp1uvw433/dataset%20%281%29.zip?dl=0

The checkpoint file is located at https://www.dropbox.com/s/vaba8ch17cvcy8c/latest.pth?dl=0

The "Endoscopic Artefact Detection.pdf" show few slides for an overview of the project.
