# Endoscopic_Artefact_Detection_FasterRCNN
This repository contains a small project for endoscopic artefact detection done with the MMDetection toolbox from OpenMMLab. The algorithm algorithm used for the object detection is Faster RCNN. Atof the project is shown few image with the classification and detection of multiple objects in endoscopy images.
